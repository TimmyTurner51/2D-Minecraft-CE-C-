Steps for Windows PCs:
1.) You will need CEDEV.
2.) Put usbdrvce.h and srldrvce.h in the CEdev include folder ( C:/CEdev/include/ ).
3.) You should be able to compile if this respository's makefile states it's currently compileable. If it isn't compileable, just 
grab the .8x files from the respository's data/ folder, and put these on your TI-84 CE calculator using TI-Connect CE.

Thanks for testing!
